## 📉 Why Vexor? ( The Proof )
I built Vexor because modern browsers like Chrome and Edge eat too much RAM, causing lag in games like **Free Fire**, **Roblox**, and **Minecraft**.

We tested Vexor against Chrome on a standard 4GB RAM Laptop. **The results speak for themselves:**

| Browser | RAM Usage (Idle) | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🔴 **Google Chrome** | **763.0 MB** | ⚠️ LAGGY |
| 🟢 **Vexor Browser** | **14.1 MB** | 🚀 FAST |

> *Vexor uses ~50x LESS RAM than Chrome, leaving more memory for your games.*

*This does not mean it is a virus. It just means I am an independent coder.*
