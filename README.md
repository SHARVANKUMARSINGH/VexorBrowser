## 📉 The Proof: Chrome vs. Vexor
I built Vexor because modern browsers eat too much RAM. If you play **Free Fire**, **Roblox**, or **Minecraft** on a 4GB laptop, you need every bit of memory you can get.

**We tested Vexor against Chrome. Here are the real results:**

| Browser | RAM Usage (Idle) | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🔴 **Google Chrome** | **763.0 MB** | ⚠️ LAGGY |
| 🟢 **Vexor Browser** | **14.1 MB** | 🚀 FAST |

> *Vexor uses ~50x LESS RAM than Chrome. The numbers don't lie.*

## ⚠️ "Windows protected your PC" Warning?
When you open Vexor for the first time, you might see a blue screen warning.

**Don't Panic. It is NOT a virus.**

* **The Reason:** Microsoft charges developers **$500+ per year** for a "Digital License" to remove that warning.
* **The Reality:** I am a solo developer making free software. I cannot afford that fee yet.

**How to open Vexor:**
1.  Click **"More Info"** (Under the text).
2.  Click the **"Run Anyway"** button.

*Once you do this, Vexor will run normally forever.*
